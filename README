# GeoLocation Utility - glu.py
This utility takes 5-digit US zip codes or "City, State" values as input, looks
them up on OpenWeatherMap's geocoding API, and displays the latitude and
longitude coordinates of that location (or locations if there is more than one
municipality with that name).

Technical requirements:
* A recent version of Python 3
* An api key from [openweathermap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)

Also see `glu.py --help` for various options.
## Quick Start
```
git clone https://github.com/jarod-codes/geolocationutility.git
cd geolocationutility
pip install requests
set OPENWEATHER_APIKEY=yourapikey
glu.py "Miami, FL" 02108 98101
```
## Description
The motivations for writing this utility:
* Reinforce and expand my Python knowledge
* Demonstrate black-box, local testing by mocking external resources
* Demonstrate integration testing

## Developing
```
git clone https://github.com/jarod-codes/geolocationutility.git
cd geolocationutility
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # UNIX-y systems
venv\Scripts\activate.bat       # Windows cmd.exe
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1       # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run only the local tests
```
pytest tests/test_glu.py
```
Run only the integration tests
```
cat yourapikey > ~/.openweather_apikey
pytest tests/test_glu_integration.py
```
Run all the tests with `pytest`
